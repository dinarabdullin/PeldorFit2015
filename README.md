PeldorFit2015
=========

Fitting of orientation selective PELDOR / DEER data by means of a genetic algorithm.

General Information
=========
This is the second version of the program PeldorFit. The changes to the first version are:

1) The ~2 times faster performance (still in order of hours on usual PC).

2) The design of the configuration file is reconsidered to make it easier and more intuitive.

3) All fitting parameters can have eigher uniform or normal distribution.

A detailed desciption of the program is given in the Manual of the program.
The program uses two external open-access libraries, Intel TBB (https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) and libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/). Both of them are required for compiling the program.

The compiled executable files for the Linux and Windows operation systems can be found at (http://www.schiemann.uni-bonn.de/index.php/software/13-peldorfit).
